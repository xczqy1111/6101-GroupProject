# 1 Introduction  

In the 21st century, climate change has become recognized as a severe global issue. "Climate change is a long-term change in the average weather patterns that have come to define Earth’s local, regional and global climates. These changes have a broad range of observed effects that are synonymous with the term." Human activities causing an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, fossil fuel burning in particular, are the driving cause of climate change and global warming. "The average increase in global temperature between 1880 and 1981 was ~0.07°C (0.13°F); however, the average rate of increase since1981 (0.18°C / 0.32°F) has more than doubled." One method for combatting climate change is to increase the supply and use of renewable energy, particularly solar energy, which allows for the replacing of carbon-intensive energy sources and an overall significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. This paper aims to focus on the availability of solar panel implementations and the potential carbon-offsets that coincide with increased solar energy use. 


**The SMART questions we will be focusing on are:**  
1. Analyze: Which variables have the greatest effect on the total solar energy generation potential?  
2. Determine: Which variables significantly effect the estimated carbon dioxide abatement?  
3. Compare: How does the estimated mean solar energy generation per panel type vary by region.  


Included in our discussion is some exploratory data analysis (EDA) focusing on cleaning the data and preparing it for model-use as well as some linear models and ANOVA tests use to help answer our SMART questions. We used multiple models to show the advantages of including certain variables and excluding others.  



# 2 EDA 
Read city and state csv files as a data frame and remove unnecessary columns.  

```{r q1}

```
Renaming the long column names to short names.  
```{r change names in citydf1}

From the bar chart above, it is obvious the south region has the most number of the cities, following by midwest, northeast and west. The number of the cities provides potential data points for the sample space. In other words, cities in the south region can have more potential solar panels installed. However, the potential number of solar panel installed is different from the actual number of solar panels installed. For the following analysis, we will be focuson the acutal solar panels installed in each region. 


**Mean energy per panel in different directions.**  

Find sunlight energy potential per panel per direction for each city.

# Add a simple table to display the total mean 
mean_per_direction <- matrix(c(mean_total_north, mean_total_south, mean_total_east, mean_total_west, mean_total_flat, mean_total_all),ncol=6, nrow=1, byrow=FALSE)
colnames(mean_per_direction) <- c("North","South","East","West","Flat","Total")
rownames(mean_per_direction) <- "Mean"
mean_per_direction_table <- as.table(mean_per_direction)
xkabledply(mean_per_direction_table, 
             title = "Estimated Mean Solar Energy Generated Per Panel By Direction")
```
From the histograms above, the mean solar energy generated in each position is right skewed distributed. Thus, the amount of energy per panel with the most frequency falls behind the overall mean in each position. 

The summary table shows the overall mean of the solar energy generated in each position. The south facing (mean of 328 kw/panel) panel and flat panel (mean of 315 kw/panel) have the most solar energy generated (General mean of 310 kw/panel). This result indicates that the south facing panel and flat panel are the two position with the highest capability of solar energy generation. 



## 2.3 Boxplots  
### 2.3.1 Carbon offset by region
```{r boxplot}
region_carbon_offset = ggplot(citydf1, aes(x = region, y = carbon_offset, col = region)) +
                    geom_boxplot() + ylim(0, 0.3e+06)+
                    labs(title = "Carbon Offset By Region", y = "Carbon Offset")
region_carbon_offset
```

From this boxplot we find that the northeast region has lower carbon offset compared with other regions. We can assume that it is because the region has low solar energy potential and prove the assumption in the following steps.

### 2.3.2 Sunlight by region and roof types
```{r boxplot for different region and different roof}
loadPkg("reshape2")
citydf1_long <- melt(citydf1,measure.vars=21:25)
region_plot <- ggplot(citydf1_long,aes(x=region,y=value,fill=variable)) +  geom_boxplot() + facet_grid(.~region, scales="free") +  labs(title = "Total Potential Solar Energy Generated Per Panel Direction By Region",x="Region",y="Total Potential Solar Energy Generated") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,1e+08)) + scale_fill_manual(values = c("red","yellow","blue","green","white"))
region_plot  
# This is the plot to compare the sunlight potential for different roof types in different regions.
region_sun_total = ggplot(citydf1,aes(x=region,y=sunlight_total,fill=region))
region_sun_total + geom_boxplot() + scale_fill_manual(values = c("red","yellow","blue","green")) + labs(title = "Total Potential Solar Energy Generated By Region",x="Region",y="Total Potential Solar Energy Generated") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,1e+09))
#This is the boxplot of total sunlight in different regions. Make the boxes higher(thicker).   
```

The first boxplot shows the solar energy potential of different types of roofs in different regions. It is easy to find that flat and south-facing roofs have more solar energy potential in any region. 

From the second plot we can know that west and south regions of America have more total sunlight potential while northeast has the least as we assumed before. That means south and west regions are more suitable to build panels, which can be proved by the next plot about the installed panels.

## 2.4 Barplots  
### 2.4.1 Total Number of Solar Panels (per direction) By Region.  

```{R, fig.height=16, fig.width=20}
# total number of solar panels(by region)
loadPkg("reshape2") # have some fun with the tech above from Qinyuan  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
sumpanels <- aggregate(cbind(panels_south, panels_east, panels_west, panels_north, panels_flat, panels_total)~region, citydf1, sum)
sumpanels_luffy = melt(sumpanels, gomu=2:7)
solar_panels_region = ggplot(sumpanels_luffy, 
                             aes(x=variable, y = value, fill=variable)) + 
                        geom_bar(stat="identity")+
                         facet_wrap(~region)+
                      theme(axis.ticks.x=element_blank(),
                            axis.text.x=element_blank())+
                       labs(title = "Total Number of Solar Panels (per direction) By Region",
                                x = "Region", y = "Total number of solar pannels")
solar_panels_region
```

The number of the solar panel is the potential data points that cities can provide. Overall, south region has the most number of installed solar panels. The second is west region which has the least number of cities counted. The least potential data points provider turns out to be the region with the second most actual data points provided. 

The flat panel and south-facing panel are the two most-installed panel in all 4 regions of United States. 


## 2.5 Scatter plots  

### 2.5.1 carbon offset vs solar panels
```{r }
cor.solar_panel <- cor(citydf1$carbon_offset,citydf1$panels_total)
ggplot(citydf1, aes(x = panels_total, y = carbon_offset)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')+
  labs(title='Carbon Offset vs Total Solar Panels', x = 'Total Solar Panels', y = 'Carbon Offset')+

cor.test(citydf1$carbon_offset,citydf1$panels_total)
cor1 <- cor.test(citydf1$carbon_offset,citydf1$panels_total)
```
The chart indicates that total number of solar panels have a significant relationship with carbon offset potential, and the coefficient is `r cor1$conf.int[1]`.


### 2.5.2 carbon offset vs Total Solar Energy Potential.
```{r }

cor.test(citydf1$carbon_offset,citydf1$sunlight_total)
cor2 <- cor.test(citydf1$carbon_offset,citydf1$sunlight_total)
```

The chart indicates that the total energy potential have a significant relationship with carbon offset potential, and the coefficient is `r cor2$conf.int[1]`.

The charts indicate that the solar panel directions, north-facing, south-facing, west-facing, east-facing, and flat, all have a significant relationship with carbon offset potential, with flat angle having the highest correlation coefficient `r cor7`, and the north-facing solar panel has the lowest coefficient `r cor3`.

### 3.1.2 Linear models to determine effects of sunlight generation potential in all the directions on total sunlight generation potential in North and South section of USA separately.  
``` {r, results='markup'}
north_us_city = subset(citydf1, lat_min >39.5)
south_us_city = subset(citydf1, lat_max <39.5)
# Effect of north/south/east/west directional facing roofs on total estimated sunlight per city. Separated into two subsets: northern US cities (having a minimum latitude of 39.5 or greater) and southern US cities (having a maximum latitude of 39.5 or less). Subsets allow us to analyze if the different directional facings roofs have separate impacts depending on which part of the country they exist in.
# Can subset further to measure effects per region (northeast, southeast, mid west, west, etc.)

## 3.2 Models on Carbon offset  

### 3.2.1 Linear models to determine effects of sunlight_total,panels_total,region and panels in all directions on `Carbon offset`.

#### 3.2.1.1 model 1, dependent variables are:  
1. total solar energy generation potential  
2. total number of solar panels  
``` {r}
fit1 <- lm(carbon_offset ~ sunlight_total + panels_total, data = citydf1)
summary(fit1)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(fit1)
```

#### 3.2.1.2 model 2, dependent variables are:  
1. total solar energy generation potential  
2. total number of solar panels  
3. region  


``` {r}
fit2 <- lm(carbon_offset ~ sunlight_total + panels_total + region, data = citydf1)
summary(fit2)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(fit2)
```

#### 3.2.1.3 model 3, dependent variables are:  
1. total solar energy generation potential  
2. total number of solar panels  
3. regions  
4. panel flat (highest correlation with carbon_offset)  

``` {r}
fit3 <- lm(carbon_offset ~ sunlight_total + panels_total + region + panels_flat, data = citydf1)
summary(fit3)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(fit3)
```


#### 3.2.1.4 model 4, dependent variables are:  
1. total solar energy generation potential  
2. regions  
3. all 5 panel directions  
we remove panels_total from this model because it causes perfect multicollinearity.  

``` {r}
fit4 <- lm(carbon_offset ~ sunlight_total + region + panels_flat + panels_north + panels_south + panels_east + panels_west, data = citydf1)
summary(fit4)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(fit4)
```

#### 3.2.1.5 vif tests of the four models:
```{r,results='markup'}
vif(fit1)
vif(fit2)
vif(fit3)
vif(fit4)
```

# 4 Anova Test


``` {r, results='markup'}
total_sun_north = lm(sunlight_total ~ sunlight_north, data=citydf1)
total_sun_south = lm(sunlight_total ~ sunlight_south, data=citydf1)
total_sun_east = lm(sunlight_total ~ sunlight_east, data=citydf1)
total_sun_west = lm(sunlight_total ~ sunlight_west, data=citydf1)

```

# 5 Conclusion  
## 5.1 Our Findings  
From the above tests, we conclude that Model 4 is the best model to use for determining which variables have the greatest effects on Carbon offset. The p-value in Model 4 is < 0.05, and the multiple R-squared value is 95% which means the variables in the Model 4 can explain 95% of changes in the dataset. Cook’s distance is less than 1, which means that there is no high influence of high leverage points that can alter the model. This model shows that panels in the south region create the largest positive carbon emission abatement impact while panels in the northeast and west regions have negative impacts on carbon abatement. Our boxplots show that flat panels generate the most solar power energy across all regions while panels facing north generate the least amount of solar power across all regions. **To summarize our findings, in general, flat panels in the south region of the US will generate the most solar power and have the greatest positive impact on carbon emission abatement.** This makes the most intuitive sense considering the US is in the northern hemisphere and the southern would receive the most direct sunlight, much of which will be directly overhead allowing flat panels to receive more direct sunlight than panels facing a particular direction.  

## 5.2 Caveats  

**1. Our models have high multicollinearity.** While building early models, we found high vif values and had to adjust the models multiple times to obtain desirable outcomes. Some variables were completely linearly dependent, so we had to remove them from our models to receive accurate results.  
**2. There are high outlier counts in the dataset.** We observed this in the *Total Potential Solar Energy Generated vs Region* boxplot in the EDA section. We had to adjust the y-axis improve readability of the plots. This leads some missing data in our representations.  
**3. All the values in the dataset are estimated values** obtained from the google database of imagery and maps. They are not real world recorded values obtained from readings of solar panels directly.  
**4. Since the carbon offset value was calculated by the Google Sunroof Project, we are not sure of the formula used.** Our findings of certain panel types in certain regions having negative effects on carbon emission abatement might not be totally accurate in the long-term. We assume they would have a net-positive impact over their lifespan.
